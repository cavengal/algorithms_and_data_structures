    "In assignment 1, I used Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all paths from the root to the leaves in a binary tree. I started by writing a helper function that explores the tree from the root. This function kept track of the current path and updated it as it moved to the left and right children. When it reached a leaf, it saved the path to the final list. This process helped me better understand how DFS works and how to use recursion effectively to explore tree structures.\n",

    "The above was complemented by reviewing my classmate's assignment, which was an equally valuable learning experience. The task was to find the closest duplicate value in a binary tree, and the solution used breadth-first search (BFS) to do this. BFS processed each level of the tree, ensuring the closest duplicate was found first. The solution also correctly handled an empty tree by returning -1. The time and space used were both O(n), which is efficient for this type of problem. Overall, the assignment showed a clear understanding of tree traversal and problem-solving, and it was a good example of how to efficiently solve such problems and address common edge cases."
